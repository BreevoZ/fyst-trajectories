"""A pong or daisy visit keeps its whole scan pattern inside the elevation limits.

The offline scheduler builds every science subscan through the rebuild path
before it books it, and idles with ``reason="unplannable"`` on a refusal.
These tests pin that a patch whose pattern edge, rather than its field
centre, is under the lower limit is not selected, slewed to and refused, and
that the subscan it books is one the planner builds:

- ``_time_inside_el_limits``: how long the whole pattern stays inside the
  limits from when its subscan starts, checked against trajectories the
  planner builds.
- ``_pattern_el_bounds``: every sample of a built pattern lies between the
  bounds, and a pong comes within a hundredth of a degree of its lowest
  corner's, whatever the pattern's ``angle``.
- end to end, through ``generate_timeline``: a daisy near setting and a pong
  near rising on 2026-06-15, the two cases of the sims source list's night,
  where a selection by the field centre slews to the patch and idles
  ``unplannable`` tick after tick.
- the slew's arrival: a setting pattern, a Sun clip or the schedule end that
  closes the window within the slew leaves the telescope where it is, with
  the tick's idle labelled ``unplannable``.
- the zenith: a pong whose box holds the zenith near transit, where its
  track winds its azimuth round the zenith and the planner refuses it, is
  not scanned while the circle about its centre through its corners holds
  the zenith, and the night idles in place rather than slewing to it.
