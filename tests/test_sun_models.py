"""A Sun model's ``batch`` solves the Sun once per distinct instant.

The offline scheduler's Sun clip asks an injected model about a grid that
repeats every sampled time across each azimuth column of a span, so the
Sun's position is solved for each distinct instant once and spread over
the grid. These tests pin that the verdicts are the ones each instant gets
on its own, and that the ephemeris is asked about each instant once. They
need no shared library: every model reaches the ephemeris through the same
base-class path, exercised here with the scalar model.
