"""Policies, per-visit overrides and the night's metadata payload.

The policy objects hold what the instrument and operations teams decide
for a commissioning night: the observing floor, the sweep speed and
acceleration, the footprint, how long a solved crossing may take, the
idle tick and the retry interval. Per-visit :class:`ScanOverrides` win
over the policy and the tables. :class:`CalibrationNightMetadata` is the
record a planned night stores in the timeline header so it can be read

    Parameters

        Duration of that operation in seconds. A placeholder pending an

    skydip_after_retune : bool, optional
        Reserve a skydip immediately after the retune before each scan

class CalibrationNightPolicy:
    """What a commissioning night may do and how its scans are shaped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    el_min : float, optional
        Observing floor in degrees for the pass's boresight elevation.
        Default 30.
    max_pass_seconds : float, optional
        A solved footprint crossing longer than this is refused as too
        slow for now (the body is retried later). Default 1200.
    az_speed : float, optional
        Per-leg azimuth speed in deg/s. Default 1.5, a commissioning value
        rather than a ratified limit.
    az_accel : float, optional
        Nominal azimuth acceleration in deg/s^2. Default 1.0, a
        commissioning value rather than a ratified limit; the quintic
        turnaround peaks at 1.5 times this value, 1.5 deg/s^2 at the
        default.
    footprint : str, optional
        The Prime-Cam module the passes are planned on, by one name as
        :func:`~fyst_trajectories.primecam.get_primecam_offset` takes it
        (``"c"`` or its aliases ``"center"`` and ``"IM0"``, or ``"i1"`` ..
        ``"i6"``, in any case). A pass's dispatch dict names the module by
        its canonical name, ``"c"`` or ``"i1"`` .. ``"i6"``, since the
        execution layer compares the name as a string; the night's record
        keeps the name as given. Default ``"c"``; a tag naming any other
        module is accepted for simulation and a warning recorded (in
        ``VisitPlan.warnings`` and the night's metadata), since the
        execution layer accepts centred footprints only.
    footprint_margin : float, optional
        On-sky margin in degrees added on every side of the footprint
        before the crossing is solved. Default 0.
    n_passes : int, optional
        Passes per visit. Default 1.
    use_table_dwell : bool, optional
        Apply the table's reference dwell instead of the solved crossing.
        Default False; a reference dwell longer than the solved crossing
        is not applied (the full crossing is scanned and a warning
        recorded).
    use_table_throw : bool, optional
        Sweep the table's azimuth throw instead of the throw solved from
        the footprint. Default False: each pass sweeps the footprint's
        azimuth extent at its elevation (the margined module's width over
        the cosine of the elevation), with no padding. When True, the
        table's throw is swept at and above the table's lowest bin
        (extrapolated above its top bin) and, below it, the kernel's
        default padded throw.
    dispatch_lead_seconds : float, optional
        Seconds reserved between the end of the detector operations and
        the start of each pass. The planner's search for the pass, whose
        start the dispatch sheet prints as ``scheduled_t0_unix``, begins
        the lead after the operations' end as estimated before the slew is
        planned (the estimate prices the slew to where the body will be at
        the anchor and adds the settle), so it sits the lead after the
        operations to within about a second for a single pass of the
        centre module (a multi-pass visit or a ring module, planned for
        simulation, up to a few seconds), while the pass itself, which
        starts the kernel's own offset after the search start, never
        starts sooner than the lead after them. The
        execution layer floors a dispatch's start to
        ``SCAN_DISPATCH_BUFFER_SEC`` after the dispatch (10 s in PCS at the
        revision this library is checked against) and searches for the
        pass from the later of that floor and ``scheduled_t0_unix``: a
        later floor finds the same crossing to within some tens of
        milliseconds, until it passes the pass start, where the task
        refuses the pass. Default 20: PCS's 10 s floor plus about ten
        seconds for the dispatch path (the completion of the operation
        before the pass, the OCS round trips and the script's own
        latency). A later pass of a multi-pass visit is kept only when it
        starts at least the step to it plus the lead after the previous
        kept pass ends. 0 reserves nothing.
    min_pass_seconds : float, optional
        The night ends when less than this remains. Default 60.
    retry_after_seconds : float, optional
        How long a deferred body waits before it is a candidate again.
        Default 300.
    max_wait_seconds : float, optional
        How long a scripted entry waits for its body before it is set
        aside as unplaced. Default 3600.
    time_step : float, optional
        Idle tick in seconds. Default 300.
    moon_min_separation : float, optional
        Minimum separation from the Moon in degrees; ``None`` (default)
        disables the check.
    allow_detour : bool, optional
        Let a Sun-blocked direct slew be replaced by a two-leg detour.
        Default False.
    tuning : TuningPolicy, optional
        Where the detector operations go.
